# What’s new in Swift 4.2

This playground is designed to showcase new features introduced with Swift 4.2. I already [wrote an article on it](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/77/whats-new-in-swift-4-2), but it's a lot more fun to see things in action and experiment yourself.

If you hit problems or have questions, you're welcome to tweet me [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) or email <paul@hackingwithswift.com>.

- important: Until a version of Xcode ships with Swift 4.2, you should [download the latest Swift trunk development snapshot](https://swift.org/blog/4-2-release-process/) and activate it inside your current Xcode version.
